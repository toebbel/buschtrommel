			<t>This document is a draft for the official specification of the Buschtrommel protocol. Buschtrommel is used to find and transfer files between clients in the same network domain without the need for a central server.</t>

		<section title="Introduction">
			<t>This document specifies the Buschtrommel protocol, which is used for ad-hoc file transfer between peers in the same network domain.</t>
			<t>This specificiation defines package formats and required client behavior to enable such file transfers between conforming, well-behaved clients.</t>
			<t>This document describes the mechanisms required for completion of the following tasks:
				<list style="symbols">
					<t>peer and file announcement</t>
					<t>file transfer</t>
				</list>
			</t>
			<t>The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED",  "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119.</t>
		</section>

		<section title="High Level Overview">
			<t>
				Buschtrommel is focused on scenarios, where the set of shared files is changed frequently. Files are announced in a short-termed fashion. Clients will not be connected for more than a few hours. The fast announcement of new clients and files is one of the main focuses.
			</t>
			<t>The protocol features can be roughly split into four tasks:
				<list style="symbols">
                    <t>announcements of peers</t>
                    <t>exploration of offered files</t>
                    <t>updates of offered files</t>
					<t>file transfers</t>
				</list>
			</t>
			<t>
				Announcement and update features are implemented on top of UPD and multicast groups.
				File transfers and file explorations use TCP peer-to-peer connections.
			</t>

        <section title="General Notes">
            <t>
                Buschtrommel uses the following multicast addresses to address all participating peers:
                <list style="symbols">
                    <t>239.255.0.113 for IPv4</t>
                    <t>ff02::7171 for IPv6</t>
                </list>
                Clients have to listen on UDP Port XXX in order to participate in the network
                
                Messages are encoded as UTF-8 strings and contain of multiple fields. 
                | represents a field seperator and is encoded with the ascii control character 31 (unit seperator)
                \ represents an entry seperator and is encoded with the ascii control character 30 (record seperator) //TODO reference to rfc
                Integers are represented as UTF-8 integegers as well.
                Hashes are represented as UTF-8 hex strings.
            </t>
        </section>

        <section title="Announcements of peers">
            <section title="HI message">
            <t>
                Clients send a HI message, after joining the multicast group:
                <figure>
                    <artwork>
HI|Port|Alias\
                    </artwork>
                </figure>

                The port represents an open TCP port at the sender, which is used for TCP communication.
                The port is XXX by default, but can be choosen freely by the sender. The given port MUST fit into a 64bit Integer //TODO 32bit?
                The alias is a human readable name of the peer. It can may be empty
                The HI message MUST NOT exceed a total length of 512 Byte due restrictions of UDP.
                There are no spaces between fields and their seperatos
            </t>
            </section>
            <section title="JO message">
                <t>
                <figure>
                    <artwork>
                        JO|Port|Alias\
                    </artwork>
                </figure>
                    Clients may respond to a HI message by sending a JO message. The answer can be sent via unicast to the sender of the HI message, or via mutlicast. 
                    Other clients SHOULD handle such multicast JO messages as alive-messages.
                    Clients MUST NOT sent JO messages in response to JO messages.
                    There are no spaces between fields and their seperators.
                </t>
            </section>
		</section>

        <section title="Exploration of offered files">
            <t>
                Initial exploration of file lists is done via TCP unicast: Client A opens a TCP connection to the open port of client B and writes "GETFILELIST\" into the stream
                Client B answers with a Response code and the expected transfer volume like in "File Transfer" //TODO ref, followed by a string that represents the filelist.
                The filelist contains multiple entries, each one formated as follows:
                <figure>
                    <artwork>
hash|TTL|length|virtual path|meta-info\
                    </artwork>
                </figure>
                <list style="symbols">
                    <t>TTL in seconds, limited by unsigend int 32</t>
                    <t>virtual path uses / as path seperator only. The virtual path may be changed and MUST NOT be used for file identification.</t>
                    <t>The Meta field can contain any human readable description of the file</t>
                    <t>One FileList entry must not exceed the length of 512 Bytes</t>
                    <t>There are no spaces between the content of a field and their seperators</t>
                </list>
                An empty file list has a length of 0. the response of client B would look like the following:
                <figure>
                    <artwork>
OK|0\
                    </artwork>
                </figure>
            </t>
        </section>

        <section title="Updates of offered files">
            <t>
                Thos updates are sent via UDP multicast and repesent updates of a filelist of a client.
                A client SHOULD NOT sent updates of offered files, instead of offering his file list to other clients.
                One UDP datagram contains exactly one file update, which is the same as one file entry of the file list (with all it's limitations):
                <figure>
                    <artwork>
hash|TTL|length|virtual path|meta-info\
                    </artwork>
                </figure>
                //TODO ref Exploration of offered files
			</t>
		</section>

		<section title="File Transfer">
			<t>
                To request a file an client opens a TCP Connection to the open port of the remote peer and writes
                <figure>
                    <artwork>
GET|hash|offset|length\
                    </artwork>
                </figure>
                To request a file. 
                
                The hash field contains the hash of a file, that is requested. A client SHOULD requst only thos file, that have been announced before via file list or file updates and have a valid TTL.
                The offet defines the byte in the file, from wich on the sender sends.
                The length defines the number of bytes to transfer, from the offset on.
			</t>
            <t>
                The client, that received such a request MUST response in the following format via the same TCP connection:
                <figure>
                    <artwork>
status code|expected transfer volume\
                    </artwork>
                </figure>
                Expected transfer volume is the amount of bytes, that will follow.
                Valid status Codes are "ok", "try again, later", try again, never" //TODO find good names
                If the status code is "ok", the the clients sends the file after the \ seperator.
                The receiving, as well as the sending peer MAY terminate the TCP connection at any given time.
            </t>
