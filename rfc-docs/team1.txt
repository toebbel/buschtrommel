Abstract

   This document is a draft for the official specification of the
   Buschtrommel protocol.  Buschtrommel is used to find and transfer
   files between hosts in the same network domain without the need for a
   central server.

1.  Introduction

   This document specifies the Buschtrommel protocol, which is used for
   ad-hoc file transfer between peers in the same network domain.

   This specificiation defines package formats and required client
   behavior to enable such file transfers between conforming, well-
   behaved clients.

   This document describes the mechanisms required for completion of the
   following tasks:

   o  peer and file announcement

   o  file transfer

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119.


2.  High Level Overview

   Buschtrommel is focused on scenarios, where clients (a.k.a peers) don
   not share files for a long time.  Files are announced in a short-
   termed fashion.  Clients will not be connected for more than a few
   hours.  The fast announcement of new clients and files is one of the
   main focuses.

   The protocol features can be roughly split into two groups:

   o  announcement of peers and files

   o  file transfers

   Propagation features are implemented on top of UPD and multicast
   groups.  File transfers uses TCP peer-to-peer connections.


3.  General Notes

   The Buschtrommel protocol extensively uses the magic number 0x71 (113
   in decimal) to faciliate distinguishing Buschtrommel's messages from
   other protocols and applications.

   Throughout this document, commands are explained with diagrams.
   Command fields are identified with capital letters, e.g.  LEN.  The
   corresponding decimal values specify the number of octets reserved
   for the field.  Hexadecimal numbers written as 0xXX have a size of
   one octet.  All multi-octet values are expected to be in network byte
   order.


4.  Peer and File Announcement

   There are no mechanisms like file list requests or hello messages.
   Every peer announces himself and all offered files from time to time
   with so-called announcement messages.  These messages have a TTL.  A
   client, has to join a defined multicast group, if he wants to
   announce his presence (including his files), or wants to receive
   other clients' announcement messages.  A client SHOULD be in the
   multicast group as long as it is running.  Conventially, this
   multicast group is:

   o  239.255.0.113 for IPv4

   o  ff02::7171 for IPv6

   All announcement communication takes place over UDP on port 1113.

   Upon joining the group, the peer SHOULD send his first announement
   message to the group:

             +------+------+------+----------+-----+----------+
             | MAG  |  OP  |  LEN |   NAME   | TTL |  FILES   |
             +------+------+------+----------+-----+----------+
             | 0x71 | 0x0  |  13  |    24    |  6  | 0 - 8164 |
             +------+------+------+----------+-----+----------+

   The LEN field specifies the length of the data that follows after the
   NAME field (unsigned int ranging from 0 to 2^13-1).  The maximum
   value for LEN is 8150.  The NAME field contains a human readable name
   of the client (represented in ASCII chars).  The name can contain all
   ASCII chars from 32 to 126.  Names, that are shorter than 24
   characters can be truncated with ASCII ETX code (003).  The TTL field
   indicates the valid duration of all the information that are
   contained in the message.  The TTL is to interpret as unsigned int,
   ranging from 0 to 2^6-1.  The TTL in seconds results from the formula
   seconds = (TTL * 10) + 60s.  The FILES field contains no, one, or
   multiple triples of file information, as described as follows

                    +-----------+------+--------------+
                    | FILE-HASH | SIZE | DISPLAY-NAME |
                    +-----------+------+--------------+
                    |    8      |  64  |   1 - 512    |
                    +-----------+------+--------------+
                    | ...

   FILE-HASH is the SHA-256 over the content of the file.  SIZE
   represents the number of bytes of the file.  DISPLAY-NAME is a human
   readable name for the file.  It can contain out of the ASCII chars 32
   to 126.  Names can be truncated with the ASCII ETX code (003).  Empty
   names are allowed and are represented woth the ETX code only.  After
   a truncated name or a name with the length of 512 chars, either the
   next file tripe begins, or the LEN and therefor the end of the
   message is reached.

   Consider the following restrictions:

      Clients MAY include a folder structure in the display name.  If
      clients do so, '/' (ASCII 057) MUST be used as path seperator.

      Clients MUST NOT send the very same announcement message, before
      it's TTL is expired (which is a minimum of 60 seconds).

      Clients SHALL send announcement messages, as soon as they provide
      a new file.

      Clients MAY send multiple announcement messages, containing
      disjunct files, if they need more than 8164 bytes to announce all
      files.

      When a client decides to become inactive, it SHOULD stop sending
      announcement messages and SHOULD stay online until the longest
      lasting TTL is expired.

      Clients MUST use the UDP checksum head field

      Clients SHOULD ignore incoming UDP packages that do have an
      invalid checksum


5.  File Transfer

   When a peer requests a file from a single peer, it MUST open a TCP-
   Socket with a chosen port and send a FILEREQ message to one peer,
   that offers the file:

                +------+------+------+-------+------+------+
                | MAG  |  OP  | HASH | PORT  |  OFF | LEN  |
                +------+------+------+-------+------+------+
                | 0x71 | 0x1  |   8  |  32   |  64  |  64  |
                +------+------+------+-------+------+------+

   HASH contains the SAH-256 hash of a file, that has been announced
   before.  Clients SHOULD request only files, that are contained in a
   announcement message, that has not been expired.  The PORT has to be
   a used by a fresh socket, that awaits an incoming TCP connection from
   the other peer.  The socket MUST be attached to the same ip address,
   from witch the FILEREQ was sent.  OFF indicates the offset, from
   which on the other peer should send from.  It addresses the bytes
   inside the file.  LEN indicates the number of bytes, that shall be
   sent.  This field can be set to 0, if the peer requests all bytes
   from the given offset untill the end

   When a peer wants to continue an aborted file transfer, it sends a
   new FILEREQ, with OFF indicating the first byte, that has not been
   received.

   When a peer wants to request one file from multiple hosts, it sends
   multiple FILEREQ to these hosts.  Each FILEREQ MUST contain a
   different port, different OFF and different LEN.  The OFFs and LENs
   SHOULD describe a partition of the whole file.

   Upon receiving such a message, a peer (a.k.a host) SHOULD begin with
   the file transfer.  The file transfer begins by opening the TCP
   connection on the desired port to the requester.  AS soon as the TCP
   connection is established, the FILEREQ is replayed.  The receiver MAY
   check if all information are correct to ensure, that the correct file
   and filesegment will be transmitted.  The host sends all requested
   data via the TCP socket, that is used exclusively for the requested
   file and segment.  As soon as all bytes are transmitted, the TCP
   connection MUST be closed by the sender and the receiver.  A receiver
   SHOULD close the TCP connection, if more bytes than requested are
   received.  If the TCP connection gets aborted the sender MUST NOT try
   to reconnect.  The receiver MAY reestablish a new transfer via a new
   FILEREQ.  The requester MAY assume, that the host is not avaliable,
   if he registers no incoming TCP connection on the desired port within
   30 seconds.
